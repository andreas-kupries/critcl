'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH NAME
critcl_introduction \- Introduction To CriTcl
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Welcome to the \fIC Runtime In Tcl\fR, \fICriTcl\fR for short, a
system to build C extension packages for Tcl on the fly, from C code
embedded within Tcl scripts, for all who wish to make their code go
faster.
.PP
CriTcl started life as an experiment by Jean-Claude Wippler and was a
self-contained Tcl package to build C code into a Tcl/Tk extension on
the fly. It was somewhat inspired by Brian Ingerson's \fIInline\fR
for \fIPerl\fR, but is considerably more lightweight.
.PP
It is for the last 5% to 10% when pure Tcl, which does go a long way,
is not sufficient anymore. I.e. for
.IP [1]
when the last bits of performance are needed,
.IP [2]
access to 3rd party libraries,
.IP [3]
hiding critical pieces of your library or application, and
.IP [4]
simply needing features provided only by C.
.PP
.SH "MODES OF OPERATION/USE"
CriTcl can be used in three different modes of operation, called
.IP [1]
\fICompile & Run\fR, and
.IP [2]
\fIGenerate Package\fR
.IP [3]
\fIGenerate TEA Package\fR
.PP
Of these three \fICompile & Run\fR came first and is the default
when using the package directly. In that case the package collects the
C fragments, builds them as needed, and caches the results for quick
reuse when the same code is used in the future again.
.PP
The second mode, \fIGenerate Package\fR, was introduced to enable
the creation of (prebuilt) deliverable packages which do not depend on
the existence of a build system, i.e. C compiler, on the target
machine.
This was originally done through the experimental \fBCritbind\fR tool,
and is now handled by the \fICriTcl Application\fR, also named
\fBcritcl\fR.
.PP
Newly introduced with Critcl version 3 is
\fIGenerate TEA Package\fR. This mode constructs a directory
hierarchy from the package which can later be built like a regular TEA
package, i.e. using
.CS


	.../configure --prefix ...
	make all isntall

.CE
.SH "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE"
The whole system consist of two pieces, as seen in the figure below

.SH "CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.1"
.IP [1]
Fixed bug where \fBcritcl::tsources\fR interpreted relative
paths as relative to the current working directory instead of
relative to the "\fI.critcl\fR" file using the command, as all other
commands of this type do.
.IP [2]
Fixed internals, preventing information collected for multiple
"\fI.critcl\fR" files to leak between them. Notably, \fBcritcl::tk\fR
is not a global configuration option anymore.
.IP [3]
Fixed the command \fBcritcl::license\fR to be a null-operation
in mode "compile & run", instead of throwing an error.
.IP [4]
Fixed the critcl application's interference with the "compile &
run" result cache in \fB-pkg\fR mode by having it use a wholly
separate (and by default transient) directory for that mode.
.IP [5]
Fixed bug where changes to a "\fI.critcl\fR" file did not result
in a rebuild for mode "compile & run". All relevant API commands now
ensure UUID changes.
.IP [6]
Fixed bug in the backend handling of \fBcritcl::debug\fR where
the companion c-sources of a "\fI.critcl\fR" file were not compiled
with debug options, although the "\fI.critcl\fR" file was.
.IP [7]
Fixed bug in \fBcritcl::debug\fR which prevented recognition of
mode "all" when it was not the first argument to the command.
.IP [8]
Fixed bug in "\fIpreload.c\fR" preventing its compilation on
non-windows platforms.
.IP [9]
Fixed long-standing bug in the handling of namespace qualifiers
in the command name argument of \fBcritcl::cproc\fR and
\fBcritcl::ccommand\fR. It is now possible to specify a fully
qualified command name without issues.
.IP [10]
Extended/reworked \fBcritcl::tsources\fR to be the canonical
way of declaring "\fI.tcl\fR" companion files even for mode "compile &
run".
.IP [11]
Extended/reworked \fBcritcl::tsources\fR to allow the use of a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file as its own Tcl companion file.
.IP [12]
Extended \fBcritcl::framework\fR to internally check for OS X
build target, and to ignore the declaration if its not.
.IP [13]
Extended \fBcritcl::failed\fR to be callable more than once in
a "\fI.critcl\fR" file. The first call forces the build, if it was not
done already, to get the result. Further calls return the cached
result of the first call.
.IP [14]
Extended the handling of environment variable CC in the code
determining the compiler to use to deal with (i.e. remove) paths to
the compiler, compiler file extensions, and compiler options specified
after the compiler itself, leaving only the bare name of the compiler.
.IP [15]
Extended the code handling the search for preloaded libraries
to print the paths it searched, making debugging of a search failure
easier.
.IP [16]
A new command \fBcritcl::tcl\fR can be used to declare the
version of Tcl minimally needed to build and run the "\fI.critcl\fR"
file and package. Defaults to 8.4 if not declared. Extended critcl to
have the stubs and headers for all of Tcl 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.
.IP [17]
A new command \fBcritcl::load\fR forces the build and load of a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file. This is the official way for overriding critcl's
default lazy-build-&-load-on-demand scheme for mode "compile & run".
.sp
\fINote\fR that after using \fBcritcl::load\fR /
\fBcritcl::failed\fR in a "\fI.critcl\fR" file it is not possible to
use critcl commands in that file anymore. Doing so will throw an
error.
.IP [18]
Extended the generation of '#line' pragmas to use
\fBinfo frame\fR (if available) to provide the C compiler with exact
line numbers into the "\fI.critcl\fR" file for the reporting of
warnings and errors.
.IP [19]
Extended \fBcritcl::check\fR with logging to help with
debugging build-time checks of the environment, plus an additional
optional argument to provide labeling.
.IP [20]
Added a new command \fBcritcl::checklink\fR which not only
tries to check the environment via compiling the code, but also
its linkability.
.IP [21]
Added a new command \fBcritcl::msg\fR for messaging, like
command \fBcritcl::error\fR is for error reporting. Likewise this is a
hook a user of the package is allowed to override. The default
implementation, used by mode \fIcompile & run\fR does nothing. The
implementation for mode \fIgenerate package\fR prints the message
to stdout.
.sp
Envisioned use is for the reporting of results determined by
\fBcritcl::check\fR and \fBcritcl::checklink\fR during building, to
help with debugging when something goes wrong with a check.
.IP [22]
Exposed the argument processing internals of \fBcritcl::proc\fR
for use by advanced users. The new commands are
.RS
.IP [1]
\fBcritcl::argnames\fR
.IP [2]
\fBcritcl::argcnames\fR
.IP [3]
\fBcritcl::argcsignature\fR
.IP [4]
\fBcritcl::argvardecls\fR
.IP [5]
\fBcritcl::argconversion\fR
.RE
.IP
Please see section \fIAdvanced Embedded C Code\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.IP [23]
Extended the critclk package to intercept \fBpackage
provide\fR and record the file -> package name mapping. Plus other
internal changes now allow the use of namespaced package names while
still using proper path names and init function.
.IP [24]
Dropped the unused commands \fBcritcl::optimize\fR and
\fBcritcl::include\fR.
.IP [25]
Dropped \fB-lib\fR mode from the critcl application.
.IP [26]
Dropped remnants of support for Tcl 8.3 and before.
.PP
.SH "CHANGES FOR VERSION 3"
.IP [1]
The command \fBcritcl::platform\fR was deprecated in version
2.1, superceded by \fBcritcl::targetplatform\fR, yet kept for
compatibility. Now it has been removed.
.IP [2]
The command \fBcritcl::compiled\fR was kept with in version 2.1
with semantics in contradiction to its, for compatibility. This
contradiction has been removed, changing the visible semantics of the
command to be in line with its name.
.IP [3]
The change to version 3 became necessary because of the two
incompatible visible changes above.
.IP [4]
Extended the application package with code handling a new
option \fB-tea\fR. Specifying this option invokes a special mode
where critcl generates a TEA package, i.e. wraps the input into a
directory hierarchy and support files which provide it TEA-lookalike
buildsystem.
.sp
This new option, and \fB-pkg\fR, exclude each other. If
both are specified the last used option takes precedence.
.sp
The generated package directory hierarchy is mostly
self-contained, but not fully. It requires not only a working
installation of Tcl, but also working installations of the packages
\fBmd5\fR and \fBcmdline\fR. Both of these are provided by the
\fBTcllib\fR bundle. Not required, but recommended to have
installed are any of the packages which can accelerate md5's
operation, i.e. \fBcryptkit\fR, \fBtcllibc\fR, or
\fBTrf\fR.
.IP [5]
Extended the critcl package with a new command
\fBcritcl::scan\fR taking the path to a "\fI.critcl\fR" file,
statically scanning it, and returning license, version, a list of its
companion files, list of imported APIs, and list of
developer-specified custom configuration options. This data is the
foundation for the TEA wrapping described above.
.sp
Note that this is a \fIstatic\fR scan. While the other build
modes can (must) execute the "\fI.critcl\fR" file and make
platform-specific decisions regarding the assembled C code, companion
files, etc. the TEA wrap mode is not in a position to make
platform-specific decisions. It has to wrap everything which might
conceivably be needed when actually building. Hence the static scan.
This has however its own set of problems, namely the inability to
figure out any dynamic construction of companion file paths, at least
on its own. Thus:
.IP [6]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command
\fBcritcl::owns\fR. While this command is ignored by the regular build
modes the static scanner described above takes its arguments as the
names of companion files which have to be wrapped into the TEA package
and could not be figured by the scanner otherwise, like because of
dynamic paths to \fBcritcl::tsources\fR, \fBcritcl::csources\fR,
getting sourced directly, or simply being adjunct datafiles.
.IP [7]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command
\fBcritcl::api\fR for the management of stubs tables, be it their use,
and/or declaration and export.
.sp
Please see section \fIStubs Table Management\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.IP [8]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command
\fBcritcl::userconfig\fR for the management of developer-specified
custom configuration options, be it their use and/or declaration.
.sp
Please see section \fICustom Build Configuration\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.IP [9]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the
commands \fBcritcl::description\fR, \fBcritcl::summary\fR,
\fBcritcl::subject\fR, \fBcritcl::meta\fR, and
\fBcritcl::buildrequirement\fR for the declaration of TEApot meta data
for/about the package.
.sp
Please see section \fIPackage Meta Data\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.PP
.SH "CHANGES FOR VERSION 3.0.1"
.IP [1]
Bugfixes all around. In detail:
.IP [2]
Fixed recording of Tcl version requirements. Keep package name
and version together, unbreaking generated meta data and generated
package load command.
.IP [3]
Fixed the build scripts: When installing, or wrapping for TEA,
generate any missing directories
.IP [4]
Modified the build scripts to properly exit the application
when the window of their GUI is closed through the (X) button.
.IP [5]
Removed an 8.5-ism (open wb) which had slipped into the main
build script.
.IP [6]
Modified the example build scripts to separate the output for
the different examples (and packages) by adding empty lines.
.IP [7]
stack::c example bugfix: Include API declarations for use in
the companion files.
.IP [8]
Extended the documentation: Noted the need for a working
installation of a C compiler.
.IP [9]
Extended the Windows target definitions and code to handle the
manifest files used by modern MS development environments. Note that
this code handles both possibilities, environment using manifests, and
(old(er)) environments without.
.IP [10]
Extended the Windows 64bit target definitions and code to
auto-detect the need for the helper library "bufferoverflowU.lib" and
reconfigure the compile and link commands appropriately. We assume
that the library must be linked when present. This should be no harm
if the library is present, yet not needed. Just superfluous. We search
for the library in the paths specified by the environment variable
LIB.
.PP
.SH "CHANGES FOR VERSION 3.0.2"
.IP [1]
Fixed issue in compile-and-run mode where commands put into the
auto_index are not found by Tcl's [unknown] command.
.IP [2]
Fixed an array key mismatch breaking usage of client data and
delete function for procedure. Reported by Jos DeCoster, with patch.
.IP [3]
Implemented a command line option \fB-L\fR, an equivalent of
option \fB-I\fR, just for library search paths.
.IP [4]
Fixed github issues 5 and 8. Working around a missing variable
::errorInfo. It should always be present, however there seem to be
revisions of Tcl around which violate this assumption.
