'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Welcome to the \fIC Runtime In Tcl\fR, \fICriTcl\fR for short, a
system to build C extension packages for Tcl on the fly, from C code
embedded within Tcl scripts, for all who wish to make their code go
faster.
.PP
This document is the reference manpage for the \fBcritcl\fR
package. This package is the system's core, i.e. it provides the
essential functionality on top of which everything else is built.
Its intended audience are mainly developers wishing to write Tcl
packages with embedded C code. Some of its sections are however
for developers wishing to understand the package internals, and
the API it provides to the \fICriTcl Application\fR. These
sections will be marked, allowing package writers to skip them.
Users of \fBcritcl\fR on the other hand are hereby refered to the
applications' manpage, i.e. \fICriTcl Application\fR.
If you are in need of an overview of the whole system instead, please
go and read the \fIIntroduction To CriTcl\fR.
.PP
This package resides in the Core Package Layer of CriTcl.

.SH API
A short note ahead of the documentation: Instead of repeatedly talking
about
"a "\fI.tcl\fR" with embbedded C code", or
"a "\fI.tcl\fR" containing critcl commands", etc.
we use a shorthand and simply call them "\fI.critcl\fR" files,
regardless of their file extension.
.SS "EMBEDDED C CODE"
The package provides five commands to declare various types of C code
fragments. These are:
.TP
\fB::critcl::ccode\fR \fItext\fR
This command compiles the C code in \fItext\fR and makes the
contained definitions (variables, functions, macros, etc.) available
to all C code fragments specified after it. It itself can assume to
have access to all definitions which were specified before it.
See section \fBRuntime Behaviour\fR for more details.
.sp
The result of the command is the empty string.
.TP
\fB::critcl::ccommand\fR \fItclname\fR \fIcfunname\fR
This command creates a new Tcl command named \fItclname\fR which is
implemented by the C function \fIcfunname\fR.
It is expected that \fIcfunname\fR has the proper signature for a Tcl
command function, and was declared already.
.sp
The result of \fB::critcl::ccommand\fR itself is the empty
string.
.TP
\fB::critcl::ccommand\fR \fItclname\fR \fIarguments\fR ?\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR...? \fIbody\fR
This form of \fBcritcl::ccommand\fR creates a new Tcl command named
\fItclname\fR which is implemented by the C code in \fIbody\fR.
.sp
The command wraps the \fIbody\fR in an invisible C function,
compiles it and makes the resulting definition available to all C code
fragments declared later on. It itself can assume to have access to
all definitions which came before it.
See section \fBRuntime Behaviour\fR for more details.
.sp
The result of \fBcritcl::ccommand\fR itself is the empty
string.
.sp
The list of \fIarguments\fR contain the names for the four
parameters required by a Tcl command function. Superfluous list
elements (i.e. beyond the fourth) are ignored. Missing elements
(parameters), and empty parameter names are handled by replacing them
with standard names. These are, in order of usage

.RE
The only options accepted by this command are:
.RS
.TP
\fB-clientdata\fR \fIc-expression\fR
The value of this option is the text of a single C expression. The
value of expression is used in the generated C statement registering
\fItclname\fR to initialize the client data of the new Tcl command.
If not specified the expression defaults to \fBNULL\fR, i.e. no
client data.
.TP
\fB-delproc\fR \fIc-expression\fR
The value of this option is the text of a single C expression. The
value of this expression has to be a function pointer of type
"Tcl_CmdDeleteProc", which is used in the generated C statement
registering \fItclname\fR to initialize a deletion function for the
new Tcl command, i.e. a function which is run by Tcl when the Tcl
command is deleted again.
If not specified the expression defaults to \fBNULL\fR, i.e. no
deletion function.
.RE
A ccommand is, in comparison to functions defined via
\fBcritcl::cproc\fR, more lower level.
Its advantage is that the developer \fIcan\fR do their own argument
processing, enabling things like variable number of arguments,
options, etc., i.e. much higher flexibility.
Their disadvantage is that you \fIhave\fR to do your own argument
processing. Where a \fBcritcl::cproc\fR generates the code to convert
from Tcl values to C values and back a \fBcritcl::ccommand\fR forces
the writer to do all of this on their own. I.e. the cost of the
aforementioned flexibility is a higher complexity seen by the user.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cdata\fR \fItclname\fR \fIdata\fR
This command a new Tcl command named \fItclname\fR which returns
\fIdata\fR as a ByteArray result.
.sp
The result of \fBcritcl::cdata\fR itself is the empty string.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cdefines\fR \fIdefinitions\fR ?\fInamespace\fR?
This command creates Tcl variables in the specified \fInamespace\fR
which are linked to the \fIC enum values\fR and \fI#define\fRs
named as \fIglob patterns\fR in the list of \fIdefinitions\fR. Each
variable has the same name as the definition which gave rise to it,
and its value is the value of the corresponding enum value or
#define. The namespace defaults to the global namespace, i.e. "::", if
it wasn't specified explicitly.
.sp
Please note that this command is only for the lifting of
\fIexisting\fR C definitions into Tcl. The command \fIdoes not\fR
create the definitions in C. It actually goes so far to check for the
presence of the named definitions and not performing the mapping for
any which do not exist. Which is sensible, given that non-existing
defines have no value which could be used in the mapping.
.sp
As these checks are run at the time the embedded C code of a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file is actually compiled they have access to and check
\fIall\fR C fragments defined with \fBcritcl::ccode\fR, plus all the
headers it has access to via \fBcritcl::cheaders\fR, for that file.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cproc\fR \fIname\fR \fIarguments\fR \fIresulttype\fR \fIbody\fR
This command creates a new Tcl command named \fItclname\fR which is
implemented by the C code in \fIbody\fR.
In contrast to the low-level \fBcritcl::ccommand\fR here the arguments
and result are typed and critcl generates the code converting from
Tcl_Obj's to C data types, and vice versa.
The command creates two invisible C functions, one wrapping the
\fIbody\fR, the other a shim containing the necessary conversions,
compiles them and makes the resulting definitions available to all C
code fragments declared later on. It itself can assume to have access
to all definitions which came before it.
See section \fBRuntime Behaviour\fR for more details.
.sp
The result of \fBcritcl::cproc\fR itself is the empty string.
The following values are allowed for the \fIresulttype\fR:
.nf

          Types
Name      C        Tcl      Notes
-------   -------- -------- -------------------

void      void     ---      No result.
vstring   char*    String   !Volatile
-------   -------- -------- -------------------

.fi
The \fIarguments\fR parameter has the overall syntax of a Tcl
dictionary value, except that keys (argument names) and values
(argument types) are specified in reverse order. Consider the
example
.nf

int x int y

.fi where \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR are the arguments/keys, both
mapped to type/value \fBint\fR.

The following values are allowed as argument-types:

.sp
\fINote\fR that optional arguments are not possible. This
restriction is inherited from C.
.sp
Further note that the type of the first argument is allowed to
be \fBTcl_Interp*\fR. In that case the argument in question is
\fInot\fR counted as an argument of the new Tcl command.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cproc\fR \fIname\fR \fIarguments\fR \fIresulttype\fR
This variant of \fBcritcl::cproc\fR assumes that the functionality to
connect is implemented by the C function \fIname\fR which has the
signature described by the \fIarguments\fR and \fIresulttype\fR.
.sp
It creates only the shim performing the conversions required by
arguments and result.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cinit\fR \fItext\fR \fIexternals\fR
This command compiles the C code in \fItext\fR and \fIexternals\fR.
.sp
Both have access to all definitions created by the previously
listed commands, regardless of their and its placement in the
"\fI.critcl\fR" file. See section \fBRuntime Behaviour\fR for
more details.
.sp
The C code in \fItext\fR is put into the body of the
initialization function of the shared library backing the
"\fI.critcl\fR" file, and is executed when this library is loaded into
the interpreter.
.sp
The code in \fIexternals\fR on the other hand is placed outside
and just before the initialization function, making this is a good
place for any external symbols required by initialization function
which should not be accessible by any other parts of the C code.
.sp
The result of the command is the empty string.
.PP
.SS "STUBS TABLE MANAGEMENT"
Newly introduced with critcl version 3 is the support for stubs
tables, Tcl's dynamic linking mechanism handling the resolution of
symbols between C extensions.
We won't go into its details here. See \fIhttp://wiki.tcl.tk/285\fR
for an introduction in general, and section \fBStubs Tables\fR
for the details of critcl's particular variant.
.PP
Critcl supports this via a single command, \fBcritcl::api\fR,
and its methods.
.PP
First, importing stubs tables, i.e. APIs, from another
extension:
.TP
\fB::critcl::api\fR \fBimport\fR \fIname\fR \fIversion\fR
Critcl prepares the "\fI.critcl\fR" file \fIand\fR its companion
"\fI.c\fR" files by including the headers
.RS
.IP [1]
"\fI\fBname\fR/\fBname\fRDecls.h\fR"
.IP [2]
"\fI\fBname\fR/\fBname\fRStubLib.h\fR"
.RE
in the appropriate places. It is checked that the compiler will be
able to find these header files somewhere on the include search
path, using the paths defined so far (See \fBcritcl::cheaders\fR, and
the critcl application's \fB-I\fR and \fB-includedir\fR
options). Note how critcl expects the headers of package \fBfoo\fR to
reside in a sub-directory "\fIfoo\fR" of the known include search
paths.
.sp
\fIImportant:\fR If \fBfoo\fR is a namespaced package name,
like, for example "c::stack", then the namespace separators "::" are
converted into underscores ("_") in path names, C code, etc.
.sp
The first header is expected to contain contains all the
necessary stubs table type declarations, mapping macros, etc., and may
include package specific headers (See \fBcritcl::api header\fR
below).
This header is included at the beginning of the C code backing the
"\fI.critcl\fR" file, and at the beginning of all companion "\fI.c\fR"
files. This means that the writer of these files doesn't have to write
the necessary \fI#include\fR directory, critcl does it for them.
.sp
The second header is expected to contain the stubs table
variable definition, and the C code, i.e. definition, of the function
to initialize it.
This, and a call to this initializer function are added to the
"\fI.critcl\fR" file's initialization code.
.sp
If the directory containing the aforementioned headers also
contains the file "\fI\fBname\fR/\fBname\fR.decls\fR" then it is
assumed that this file contains the external representation of the
stubs table used to generate the headers. The file is read and the
internal representation of the stubs table returned as result of the
command, for the importing package to use as it sees fit. If no such
file is present the command returns the empty string as its result.
.sp
One possible use would be the automatic generation of C code
calling on the functions listed in the imported API.
.sp
When generating a TEA wrapper the names of the imported APIs
are used to declare \fBconfigure\fR options with which the user can
declare a non-standard location for the headers of the API. Any API
\fBFOO\fR is translated a single configure option
\fB--with-\fBFOO\fR-include\fR.
.PP
.PP
Second, declaration and export of a stubs table, i.e. API, for
the current package, \fBfoo\fR:
.TP
\fB::critcl::api\fR \fBfunction\fR \fIresulttype\fR \fIname\fR \fIarguments\fR
This method declares that the function \fIname\fR is in the public API
of the package, and its signature (type of the result, number, names
and types of its arguments).
Using this method automatically causes critcl to generate both the
code for a stubs table in the package, the headers needed by packages
using this API, and a "\fI.decls\fR" file containing the stubs table
implied by the exports, usable by \fBcritcl::api import\fR.
.sp
\fIarguments\fR is a list of C types and associated argument
names. Like a dictionary, except that keys (argument names) and values
(argument types) are swapped. The \fIresulttype\fR is a C type as well.
.TP
\fB::critcl::api\fR \fBheader\fR ?\fIpattern\fR...?
This method notifies critcl of companion header files which have to be
exported together with the generated stubs headers.
.sp
All arguments are interpreted as glob pattern and the matching
files are copied into the directory containing the generated headers
well. As an importing package uses only "\fI\fBfoo\fRDecls.h\fR" to
access the API this generated header will contain the necessary
\fI#include\fR directives to make these companion header files and their
declarations available too.
Patterns matching no file or non-existing files cause the command to
throw an error.
.sp
\fINote\fR that patterns which are not beginning with an
absolute path are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.TP
\fB::critcl::api\fR \fBextheader\fR ?\fIfile\fR...?
This method is similar \fB::critcl::api header\fR, in that it
notifies critcl of companion header files which have to be exported
together with the generated stubs headers.
.sp
The difference is that these headers will be expected to exist
in the external development environment.
As such they will be \fI#include\fRd in the generated header for
the package, but not copied to the package header directory. Nor are
they allowed to be glob patterns, as critcl has no context, i.e
directory, in which to expand such patterns.
.PP
Note that the generated headers for an exported API are included in
the package like it is done when importing it somewhere else. To repeat:
.PP
The "\fI\fBfoo\fRDecls.h\fR" header is included at the beginning
of the C code backing the "\fI.critcl\fR" file, and at the beginning of
all companion "\fI.c\fR" files. This means that the writer of these
files doesn't have to write the necessary \fI#include\fR directory,
critcl does it for them.
.PP
In mode "compile & run" the generated header files, and their
companion headers, if any, are placed in the subdirectory "\fIfoo\fR"
of the \fBResult Cache\fR. As this location is implicitly added
to the include search path any other package importing this API and
and build in mode "compile & run" as well will find the these headers.
.PP
For mode "generate package" the application was extended with a
new option \fB-includedir\fR which specifies the location to place
the generated headers in (again in subdirectory "\fIfoo\fR" of that
path). This path is also be added to the include search paths,
ensuring that a package importing an API will find it if the package
exporting that API used the same setting for \fB-includedir\fR.
.PP
For mode "generate TEA" the static scanner was extended to
recognize \fBcritcl::api header\fR as a source of companion files.
It further uses data about \fBcritcl::api import\fR commands to put
proper support for \fB--with-\fBfoo\fR-include\fR options into the
generate "\fIconfigure(.in)\fR" so that a user may specify custom
locations for the headers of any imported API.
.SS "PACKAGE META DATA"
Newly introduced with critcl version 3 is support for TEApot
meta-data.
.PP
While, from the package developer's perspective, some meta data
support was already present in critcl v2, through the command
\fB::critcl::license\fR, this was only used to generate and place a
file "\fIlicense.txt\fR" into the built package.
.PP
Now critcl supports the declaration of arbitrary meta data,
which will be placed into a file "\fIteapot.txt\fR" in a format
suitable for use by the
\fITEApot tools\fR [http://docs.activestate.com/activetcl/8.5/tpm/toc.html].
.TP
\fB::critcl::license\fR \fIauthor\fR ?\fItext\fR...?
This command provides information about the author of the package, and
its license.
.sp
If no \fItext\fR is present the command expects to find a file
"\fIlicense.terms\fR" in the same directory as the "\fI.critcl\fR" file
and reads the license from that. Otherwise the license is the joined
\fItext\fRs.
.sp
This information, the license, is ignored in mode "compile &
run", only mode "generate package" uses it. In that case the
information is written to a file "\fIlicense.terms\fR", a sibling to
the "\fIpkgIndex.tcl\fR" file in the directory hierarchy of the
generated package.
.sp
This information is additionally placed into the meta data file
"\fIteapot.txt\fR", under the keys \fIas::author\fR and \fIlicense\fR.
.sp
The data specified by this command has priority over any
information specified through the generic API \fB::critcl::meta\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::summary\fR \fItext\fR
Declares a short (one line is recommended) description of the package.
.sp
This information is ignored in mode "compile & run", only mode
"generate package" uses it. In that case the information is placed
into the meta data file "\fIteapot.txt\fR", under the key \fIsummary\fR.
.sp
The data specified by this command has priority over any
information specified through the generic API \fB::critcl::meta\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::description\fR \fItext\fR
Declares a longer description of the package.
.sp
This information is ignored in mode "compile & run", only mode
"generate package" uses it. In that case the information is placed
into the meta data file "\fIteapot.txt\fR", under the key \fIdescription\fR.
.sp
The data specified by this command has priority over any
information specified through the generic API \fB::critcl::meta\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::subject\fR ?\fIkey\fR...?
Declares one or more keywords and key-phrases describing the package,
for an index.
.sp
Multiple calls of this command accumulate keywords and phrases.
.sp
This information is ignored in mode "compile & run", only mode
"generate package" uses it. In that case the information is placed
into the meta data file "\fIteapot.txt\fR", under the key \fIsubject\fR.
.sp
The data specified by this command has priority over any
information specified through the generic API \fB::critcl::meta\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::meta\fR \fIkey\fR ?\fIword\fR...?
This command is for the declaration of arbitrary meta data outside of
the reserved keys
\fIas::author\fR,
\fIas::build::date\fR,
\fIdescription\fR,
\fIlicense\fR,
\fIname\fR,
\fIplatform\fR,
\fIrequire\fR
\fIsubject\fR,
\fIsummary\fR, and
\fIversion\fR,
Its behaviour is like \fB::critcl::subject\fR, in that it treats all
keys as list of words, with each call declaring one or more words for
the key, and multiple calls extending the data for an existing key, if
not reserved.
.sp
While it is possible to declare information for one of the
reserved keys with this command such data is ignored when the final
meta data is assembled and written.
.sp
Use the commands
\fB::critcl::license\fR,
\fB::critcl::summary\fR,
\fB::critcl::description\fR
\fB::critcl::subject\fR,
\fBpackage require\fR, and
\fBpackage provide\fR
to declare data for the reserved keys.
.sp
The information for the reserved keys
\fIas::build::date\fR and
\fIplatform\fR
is automatically generated by \fBcritcl\fR itself.
.TP
\fB::critcl::buildrequirement\fR \fIscript\fR
This command provides control over the capturing of dependencies
declared via \fBpackage require\fR. It runs the script, and any
dependencies declared within are ignored, i.e. not recorded in the
meta data.
.PP
.SS "CONTROL & INTERFACE"
The package provides twelve commands to control the details of
compilation and linking, enabling "\fI.critcl\fR" files to provide
custom information about their environment and dependencies.
.PP
In important thing to note about all these commands is that the
package manages their information on a per-file basis.
I.e. information provided by and in a file "\fIFOO.tcl\fR" is kept
separate from the information provided by and in a file
"\fIBAR.tcl\fR", preventing them from interfering with each other.
.PP
The commands are:
.TP
\fB::critcl::cheaders\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command provides the compile step with additional header files
and header locations.
.sp
All arguments matching the glob pattern \fB-*\fR are
forwarded to the compiler's command line when it is invoked for the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
All other arguments are interpreted as glob pattern and the
matching files are made available to the compiler when it is invoked
for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file. Patterns matching no file or
non-existing files cause the command to throw an error.
.sp
\fINote\fR that patterns which are not beginning with an
absolute path are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
\fINote\fR further that this declaration does not cause the
specified header files to be \fB#include\fR'd automatically. This
still has to be done via \fBcritcl::ccode\fR where necessary.
It does simply ensure that the compiler will be able to find these
files when invoked, by providing the necessary command line flags
extending the compiler's search paths.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::csources\fR ?\fIpattern\fR...?
This command provides the compile step with additional C source files.
.sp
All arguments are intepreted as glob patterns. Patterns
matching no file or non-existing files cause the command to throw an
error. The files matching the patterns are made available to the
compiler when it is invoked for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file. This
means that the files in question are compiled together with the
"\fI.c\fR" file backing the "\fI.critcl\fR" file into a single object.
.sp
\fINote\fR that patterns which are not beginning with an
absolute path are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::clibraries\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command provides the link step with additional libraries to link
and library locations.
.sp
All arguments matching the glob pattern \fB-*\fR are
forwarded to the linkers's command line when it is invoked for the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
All other arguments are interpreted glob patterns. Patterns
matching no file or non-existing files cause the command to throw an
error. The files matching the patterns are made available to the
linker when it is invoked for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file. This
means that the files in question are linked together with the object
file backing the "\fI.critcl\fR" file into a single shared library.
.sp
\fINote\fR that patterns which are not beginning with an
absolute path are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::tsources\fR \fIpattern\fR...
This command provides the critcl package with information about
additional Tcl script files to source when the shared library is
loaded.
.sp
All arguments are considered as glob patterns and the matching
files are made available to generated shared library when it is loaded
for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file. Patterns matching no file or
non-existing files cause the command to throw an error.
.sp
\fINote\fR that patterns which are not beginning with an
absolute path are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.sp
The declared files are sourced after the shared library has
been loaded, in the same order they were provided to \fBcritcl::tsources\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::owns\fR \fIpattern\fR...
This command is ignored by the regular build modes, i.e. both "compile
and run", and "generate package". It is present to support the static
code scanner of critcl v3's new mode to "generate TEA" packages.
.sp
In that situation it provides the critcl package with
information about any files which have to be wrapped and could not be
figured out from the previous commands (i.e. \fBcritcl::csources\fR,
\fBcritcl::tsources\fR) because of getting specified dynamically, or
getting directly sourced and this not visible to critcl in any other
way.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cflags\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command provides the compile step with additional compiler flags.
.sp
All arguments are forwarded to the compiler's command line when
it is invoked for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::ldflags\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command provides the link step with additional linker flags.
.sp
All arguments are forwarded to the linkers's command line when
it is invoked for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::framework\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command provides the link step with the names of additional
frameworks to link on MacOS X. The command is ignored if we are not
building for OS X. This means that it is possible to declare the OS X
specific frameworks unconditionally. The package itself takes care to
not use them when building for non-OS X platforms.
.sp
All arguments are forwarded to the linkers's command line when
it is invoked for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::tcl\fR \fIversion\fR
This command tells critcl for what minimum version of the Tcl runtime
to compile and link the package for. If not specified critcl falls
back to the default of \fB8.4\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::tk\fR
This command informs critcl that the package in question is based on
Tk, and therefore needs the Tk headers for compilation, and the Tk
stubs for linking.
.TP
\fB::critcl::preload\fR \fIlib\fR...
This command arranges that the named dependent external shared library is loaded
before the generated package's shared library.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.sp
Each library \fIFOO\fR named for preload will be searched at the
locations listed below, in the order listed, and the search will stop
on the first existing path.
Additional notes:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBplatform\fR is the placeholder for the target platform of the package.
.IP \(bu
The extension "\fI.so\fR" is the placeholder for whatever actual extension is used by the target platform for its shared libraries.

.SS INTROSPECTION
The package provides six commands to control compilation and linking.
These are:
.TP
\fB::critcl::check\fR ?\fIlabel\fR? \fItext\fR
This command is useful to test if some functionality is available in
the build environment, and then select other C code fragments based on
that information.
It immediately compiles the C code in \fItext\fR and returns a boolean
value based on the result of the compilation.
The command returns \fBtrue\fR on success, and \fBfalse\fR otherwise.
If specified, the \fIlabel\fR is used to uniquely mark the check in the
generated log.
.TP
\fB::critcl::checklink\fR ?\fIlabel\fR? \fItext\fR
This command is an extenson of \fBcritcl::check\fR above, useful to
test if some functionality is available in the build environment, and
then select other C code fragments based on that information.
It immediately compiles and links the C code in \fItext\fR and returns
a boolean value based on the result of compilation and linking.
The command returns \fBtrue\fR on success, and \fBfalse\fR otherwise.
If specified, the \fIlabel\fR is used to uniquely mark the check in the
generated log.
.TP
\fB::critcl::msg\fR ?\fB-nonewline\fR? \fImsg\fR
This command can be used by to report results from \fBcritcl::check\fR
and \fBcritcl::checklink\fR. The default implementation used by mode
\fIcompile & run\fR ignores any calls.
.sp
Tools like the \fICriTcl Application\fR are allowed to
redefine this procedure to perform their own way of message
reporting. The package \fBcritcl::app\fR and the application on
top print such messages to \fIstdout\fR, for example.
.TP
\fB::critcl::compiled\fR
This command returns a boolean value. It returns \fBtrue\fR if the C
code of the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file is already compiled, and
\fBfalse\fR otherwise.
.sp
This predicate effectively enables a "\fI.critcl\fR" file used
as its own Tcl companion file (see \fBcritcl::tsources\fR) to
distinguish between sourced by mode "compile & run" for compilation
and sourced from either the result of mode "generate package" or during
the load phase of "compile & run".
In case of the two latter possibilities the result is \fBtrue\fR,
and \fBfalse\fR for the first.
.TP
\fB::critcl::compiling\fR
This command returns a boolean value. It returns \fBtrue\fR if C
code can be compiled on this platform in general, i.e. if a C compiler
is available, and \fBfalse\fR otherwise.
.TP
\fB::critcl::done\fR
This command returns a boolean value. It returns \fBtrue\fR when
critcl has built the embedded C code, and \fBfalse\fR otherwise.
.sp
This enables the Tcl code of a critcl-based package to
distinguish between it getting used as a prebuilt package, versus
dynamic compile & run, and take action based on that.
.sp
\fINote\fR that this command is only useful from within a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file. The result is managed on a per-file basis, like
is done for the commands embedding C code and controlling the
behaviour of compiler and linker.
.sp
See also section \fBModes Of Operation/Use\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::failed\fR
This command returns a boolean value. It returns \fBtrue\fR if
critcl has failed to build the package. As part of this it forces the
building of the package, but not its loading. Note that it will
attempt to build the package only on the first call; future calls for
the same package will return a cached result.
.sp
This enables a critcl-based package to check itself for
availability and throw an error if it could not be built.
.sp
\fINote\fR that this command is only useful from within in a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file. The result is managed on a per-file basis, like
is done for the commands embedding C code and controlling the
behaviour of compiler and linker.
.TP
\fB::critcl::load\fR
This command is like \fBcritcl::failed\fR, except that it also forces
the loading of the generated shared library, if it was built, and that
its result has reversed sense.
.sp
It returns \fBtrue\fR if critcl succeeded in building and
loading the package.
.sp
This enables a critcl-based package to to not only check itself
for availability and throw an error if it could not be built, but also
force an immediate load, circumventing the default behaviour, which is
lazy. See also section \fBRuntime Behaviour\fR.

.PP
.SS "BUILD MANAGEMENT"
The package provides a single command for the management of global
settings, i.e. configuration options which are independent of any
"\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.PP
It is expected that this command is irrelevant to anybody just
wishing to write a "\fI.critcl\fR" file. It is a management command
which is only useful to the \fICriTcl Application\fR or similar

\fB::critcl::cache\fR ?path?
This command sets and returns the path to the directory for the
package's result cache.
.sp
The default location is
"\fI~/.critcl/[platform::generic]\fR" and usually does not
require any changes.
.TP
\fB::critcl::clean_cache\fR ?\fIpattern\fR...?
This command cleans the result cache, i.e. removes any and all files
and directories in it. If one or more patterns are specified then only
the files and directories matching them are removed.
.PP
.SS "BUILD CONFIGURATION"
This package provides four commands for the management of the
build configuration, i.e. the per-platform information about
compilers, linkers, and their commandline options.
.PP
\fINOTE\fR that these commands are irrelevant to anybody just
wishing to write a package using critcl for the C parts. They are
management commands which are only useful to the

.TP
\fB::critcl::readconfig\fR \fIpath\fR
This command reads the build configuration file at \fIpath\fR and
configures the package using the information for the currently set
target platform.
.TP
\fB::critcl::showconfig\fR ?\fIchan\fR?
This command converts the currently active build configuration into a
human-readable string and prints the result to the channel \fIchan\fR.
If \fIchan\fR is not present the string is instead returned as the
result of the command.
.TP
\fB::critcl::showallconfig\fR ?\fIchan\fR?
This command converts the set of all known build configurations (from
the currently active build configuration file last set with
\fBcritcl::readconfig\fR) into a string and print the result to the
channel \fIchan\fR.
If \fIchan\fR is not present the string is instead returned as the
result of the command.
.TP
\fB::critcl::chooseconfig\fR \fItarget\fR ?\fInomatcherr\fR?
This command takes a target identifier and matches it against all
known targets, returning a list containing all the matching ones. This
search is first done on an exact basis, and then via glob matching. If
no known target matches the argument the default is to return an empty
list. However, if the boolean \fInomatcherr\fR is specified and set,
and error will be thrown instead, using \fBcritcl::error\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::setconfig\fR \fItarget\fR
This command takes a target identifier and configures the package to
use all its settings.
.PP
.SS "TOOL API"
The eleven commands in this section provide tools like
\fICriTcl Application\fR or similar with
deeper access to the package's internals.
These commands are irrelevant to anybody just
wishing to write a "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.TP
\fB::critcl::actualtarget\fR
This command returns the platform identifier of the target platform,
i.e. the platform the generated code will be built for. In contrast to
\fB::critcl::targetplatform\fR this is the true target, with any
cross-compilation information resolved.
.TP
\fB::critcl::buildforpackage\fR ?\fIflag\fR?
This command signals whether the next file to be build is built for
inclusion into a package or not. If not specified the \fIflag\fR
defaults to \fBtrue\fR, i.e. building for a package. This disables a
number of things in the backend, namely the linking of that file into
a shared library, and loading such. It is expected that the build
results are later wrapped into a larger collection.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cnothingtodo\fR \fIfile\fR
This command checks whether there is anything to build for \fIfile\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cresults\fR ?\fIfile\fR?
This command returns the build result information for the specified \fIfile\fR.
If no file is specified the information is taken from \fBinfo script\fR.
The result in question is a Tcl dictionary with the following keys,
and their meanings:
.RS
.TP
\fBclibraries\fR
The list of external shared libraries, and/or locations thereof to
link the \fIfile\fR needs for successful linking.
.TP
\fBldflags\fR
The list of linker flags needed by the \fIfile\fR for successful linking.
.TP
\fBlicense\fR
The license the package in the \fIfile\fR is under. A string.
.TP
\fBmintcl\fR
The minimum version of Tcl required by the package in the \fIfile\fR
to run successfully. A proper Tcl version number.
.TP
\fBobjects\fR
The list of object files backing the \fIfile\fR, to be linked.
.TP
\fBpreload\fR
The list of libraries the generated package has to preload to allow
the package in the \fIfile\fR to run successfully.
.TP
\fBtk\fR
A boolean indicating whether the package in the \fIfile\fR has to be
linked against Tk or not.
.TP
\fBtsources\fR
The list of companion "\fI.tcl\fR" files to source for the package in
the "\fI.critcl\fR" \fIfile\fR to run successfully.
.TP
\fBlog\fR
The build log in case of failure, and \fB::critcl::buildforpackage\fR
having signaled the build of a package. Otherwise the empty string.
.RE
.TP
\fB::critcl::crosscheck\fR
This command checks if the package is configured for cross-compilation
and prints a message to the standard error channel if so.
.TP
\fB::critcl::error\fR \fImsg\fR
This command is used by the package to report internal errors. The default
implementation simply throws the error.
Tools like the \fICriTcl Application\fR are allowed to redefine
this procedure to perform their own way of error reporting. There is
one constraint they are not allowed to change: The procedure must
\fInot return\fR to the caller.
.TP
\fB::critcl::knowntargets\fR
This command returns a list containing the identifiers of all targets
found during the last invokation of \fBcritcl::readconfig\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::sharedlibext\fR
This command returns the file extension used by shared libraries on the
target platform.
.TP
\fB::critcl::targetconfig\fR
This command returns the target identifier chosen to by either system
or user to build code for.
.TP
\fB::critcl::buildplatform\fR
This command returns the platform identifier of the build platform,
i.e. where the package is running on.
.TP
\fB::critcl::targetplatform\fR
This command returns the platform identifier of the target platform,
i.e. the platform the generated code will be built for. In contrast to
\fB::critcl::actualtarget\fR this may be the name of a
cross-compilation target.
.TP
\fB::critcl::cobjects\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command is like \fB::critcl::clibraries\fR, provides the link
step with additional information. Instead of libraries the arguments
are object files however.
Despite this similarity it is not listed in section
\fBControl & Interface\fR because it is of no use to package
writers. Only tools like the \fICriTcl Application\fR have need
of it.
.sp
All arguments are interpreted glob patterns. Patterns matching
no file or non-existing files cause the command to throw an error. The
files matching the patterns are made available to the linker when it
is invoked for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file. This means that the
files in question are linked together with the object file backing the
"\fI.critcl\fR" file into a single shared library.
.sp
\fINote\fR that patterns which are not beginning with an
absolute path are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
current "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.sp
Multiple invokations of this command accumulate their
information.
.TP
\fB::critcl::scan\fR \fIpath\fR
This command is the main entry point to critcl's static code scanner.
Invoked for a single "\fI.critcl\fR" file it returns a dictionary providing
the following pieces information about it:
.RS
.TP
version
Package version.
.TP
org
Author(ing organization).
.TP
files
List of the companion files. The paths in this list are
all relative to the location (directory) of the input file.
.RE
This command and the information it returns can be used by tools to
implement processing modes like the assembly of a directory hierachy
containing a TEA-lookalike buildystem, etc.
.PP
.SS "ADVANCED EMBEDDED C CODE"
For the advanced user five commands used inside of \fBcritcl::cproc\fR are
exposed. These are:
.TP
\fB::critcl::argnames\fR \fIarguments\fR
This command takes an argument declaration as taken by \fBcritcl::cproc\fR
and returns a list of the user visible arguments found in the declaration.
.TP
\fB::critcl::argcnames\fR \fIarguments\fR
This command takes an argument declaration as taken by \fBcritcl::cproc\fR
and returns a list of the C side variable names for the user visible arguments
found in the declaration. The names returned here match the names used in the
declarations and code returned by \fB::critcl::argvardecls\fR and
\fB::critcl::argconversion\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::argcsignature\fR \fIarguments\fR
This command takes an argument declaration as taken by \fBcritcl::cproc\fR
and returns a list of C parameter declarations for all arguments found
in the declaration.
.TP
\fB::critcl::argvardecls\fR \fIarguments\fR
This command takes an argument declaration as taken by \fBcritcl::cproc\fR
and returns a list of C side variable declarations for the user
visible arguments found in the declaration. The names used in these
declarations match the names returned by \fB::critcl::argcnames\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::argconversion\fR \fIarguments\fR
This command takes an argument declaration as taken by \fBcritcl::cproc\fR
and returns a list of C code fragments converting the user visible arguments
found in the declaration from Tcl_Obj* to C types. The names used in these
statements match the names returned by \fB::critcl::argcnames\fR.
.PP
.SS "CUSTOM BUILD CONFIGURATION"
This package provides one command for the management of
package-specific, i.e. developer-specified custom build configuration
options.
.TP
\fB::critcl::userconfig\fR \fBdefine\fR \fIname\fR \fIdescription\fR \fItype\fR ?\fIdefault\fR?
This command defines custom build configuration option, with
\fIdescription\fR, \fItype\fR and optional \fIdefault\fR value.
.sp
The type can be either \fBbool\fR, or a list of values.
.RS
.IP [1]
For \fBbool\fR the default value, if specified, must be a
boolean. If it is not specified it defaults to \fBtrue\fR.
.IP [2]
For a list of values the default value, if specified, must be a
value found in this list. If it is not specified it defaults to the
first value of the list.
.RE
.sp
The \fIdescription\fR serves as in-code documentation of the
meaning of the option and is otherwise ignored. When generating a TEA
wrapper the description is used for the \fBconfigure\fR option
derived from the option declared by the command.
.sp
A boolean option \fBFOO\fR are translated into a pair of
configure options, \fB--enable-\fBFOO\fR\fR and
\fB--disable-\fBFOO\fR\fR, whereas an option whose \fItype\fR is a
list of values is translated into a single configure option
\fB--with-\fBFOO\fR\fR.
.TP
\fB::critcl::userconfig\fR \fBquery\fR \fIname\fR
This command queries the database of custom build configuration option
for the current "\fI.critcl\fR" file and returns the chosen value.
This may be the default if no value was set via
\fB::critcl::userconfig set\fR.
.sp
It is at this point that definitions and set values are brought
together, with the latter validated against the definition.
.TP
\fB::critcl::userconfig\fR \fBset\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
This command is for use by a tool, like the \fBcritcl\fR application,
to specify values for custom build configuration options.
.sp
At the time this command is used only the association between
option name and value is recorded, and nothing else is done. This
behaviour is necessary as the system may not know if an option of the
specified name exists when the command is invoked, nor its type.
.sp
Any and all validation is defered to when the value of an
option is asked for via \fB::critcl::userconfig query\fR.
.sp
This means that it is possible to set values for any option we
like, and the value will take effect only if such an option is both
defined and used later on.
.PP
.SH CONCEPTS
.SS "MODES OF OPERATION/USE"
CriTcl can be used in three different modes of operation, called
.IP [1]
\fICompile & Run\fR, and
.IP [2]
\fIGenerate Package\fR
.IP [3]
\fIGenerate TEA Package\fR
.PP
Of these three \fICompile & Run\fR came first and is the default
when using the package directly. In that case the package collects the
C fragments, builds them as needed, and caches the results for quick
reuse when the same code is used in the future again.
.PP
The second mode, \fIGenerate Package\fR, was introduced to enable
the creation of (prebuilt) deliverable packages which do not depend on
the existence of a build system, i.e. C compiler, on the target
machine.
This was originally done through the experimental \fBCritbind\fR tool,
and is now handled by the \fICriTcl Application\fR, also named
\fBcritcl\fR.
.PP
Newly introduced with Critcl version 3 is
\fIGenerate TEA Package\fR. This mode constructs a directory
hierarchy from the package which can later be built like a regular TEA
package, i.e. using
.nf

	.../configure --prefix ...
	make all isntall

.fi
.PP
Regarding the caching of results please read the section about
the \fBResult Cache\fR fore more details.
.SS "RUNTIME BEHAVIOUR"
The default behaviour of critcl, the package is to defer the
compilation, linking, and loading of any C code as much as possible,
given that this is an expensive operation, mainly in the time
required.
In other words, the C code embedded into a "\fI.critcl\fR" file is
built only when the first C command or procedure it provides is
invoked.
This part of the system uses standard functionality built into the Tcl
core, i.e. the \fBauto_index\fR variable to map from commands to
scripts providing them and the \fBunknown\fR command using this
information when the command is needed.
.PP
A \fIlimitation\fR of this behaviour is that it is not
possible to just use \fBinfo commands\fR check for the existence of
a critcl defined command. It is also necessary to search in the
\fBauto_index\fR array, in case it has not been build yet.
.PP
This behaviour can be changed by using the control command
\fBcritcl::load\fR. When invoked, the building, including loading of
the result, is forced. After this command has been invoked for a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file further definition of C code in this file is not
allowed any longer.
.SS "FILE MAPPING"
Each "\fI.critcl\fR" file is backed by a single private "\fI.c\fR" file
containing that code, plus the boilerplate necessary for its
compilation and linking as a single shared library.
.PP
The \fBEmbedded C Code\fR fragments appear in that file
in the exact same order it was defined in its "\fI.critcl\fR" file,
with one exception. The C code provided via \fBcritcl::cinit\fR is put
after all other fragments.
In other words all fragments have access to the symbols defined by
earlier fragments, and the \fBcritcl::cinit\fR fragment has access to
all, regardless of its placement in the "\fI.critcl\fR" file.
.PP
Note: A \fIlimitation\fR of the current system is the near
impossibility of C level access between different critcl-based
packages. The issue is not the necessity of writing and sharing the
proper \fBextern\fR statements, but that the management (export and
import) of package-specific stubs-tables is not supported. This means
that dependent parts have to be forcibly loaded before their user,
with all that entails. See section \fBRuntime Behaviour\fR for
the relevant critcl limitation, and remember that many older platforms
do not support the necessary resolution of symbols, the reason why
stubs were invented for Tcl in the first place.
.SS "RESULT CACHE"
The compilation of C code is time-consuming \fBcritcl\fR not only
defers it as much as possible, as described in section
\fBRuntime Behaviour\fR, but also caches the results.
.PP
This means that on the first use of a "\fI.critcl\fR" file
"\fIFOO.tcl\fR" the resulting object file and shared library are saved
into the cache, and on future uses of the same file reused,
i.e. loaded directly without requiring compilation, provided that the
contents of "\fIFOO.tcl\fR" did not change.
.PP
The change detection is based MD5 hashes. A single hash is
computed for each "\fI.critcl\fR" file, based on hashes for all C code
fragments and configuration options, i.e. everything which affects the
resulting binary.
.PP
As long as the input file doesn't change as per the hash a
previously built shared library found in the cache is reused,
bypassing the compilation and link stages.
.PP
The command to manage the cache are found in section
\fBResult Cache Management\fR.
Note however that they are useful only to tools based on the package,
like the \fICriTcl Application\fR. Package writers have no need
of them.
.PP
As a last note, the default directory for the cache is chosen
based on the chosen build target. This means that the cache can be put
on a shared (network) filesystem without having to fear interference
between machines of different architectures.
.SS "PRELOADING FUNCTIONALITY"
The audience of this section are developers wishing to understand
and possibly modify the internals of critcl package and application.
Package writers can skip this section.
.PP
It explains how the preloading of external libraries is realized.
.PP
Whenever a package declares libraries for preloading critcl will build
a supporting shared library providing a Tcl package named "preload".
This package is not distributed separately, but as part of the package
requiring the preload functionality.
This support package exports a single Tcl command
.TP
\fB::preload\fR \fIlibrary\fR
which is invoked once per libraries to preload, with the absolute path
of that \fIlibrary\fR. The command then loads the \fIlibrary\fR.
.sp
On windows the command will further use the Tcl command
\fB::critcl::runtime::precopy\fR to copy the \fIlibrary\fR to the
disk, should its path be in a virtual filesystem which doesn't
directly support the loading of a shared library from it.
.PP
The command \fB::critcl::runtime::precopy\fR is provided by the file
"\fIcritcl-rt.tcl\fR" in the generated package, as is the command
\fB::critcl::runtime::loadlib\fR which generates the
\fIifneeded script\fR expected by Tcl's package management. This
generated ifneeded script contains the invokations of \fB::preload\fR.
.PP
The C code for the supporting library is found in the file
"\fIcritcl_c/preload.c\fR", which is part of the \fBcritcl\fR
package.
.PP
The Tcl code for the supporting runtime "\fIcritcl-rt.tcl\fR" is found
in the file "\fIruntime.tcl\fR", which is part of the
\fBcritcl::app\fR package.
.SS "CONFIGURATION INTERNALS"
The audience of this section are developers wishing to understand
and possibly modify the internals of critcl package and application.
Package writers can skip this section.
.PP
It explains the syntax of configuration files and the configuration
keys used by \fBcritcl\fR to configure its build backend, i.e. how
this part of the system accesses compiler, linker, etc.
.PP
It is recommended to open the file containing the standard
configurations ("\fIpath/to/critcl/Config\fR") in the editor of your
choice when reading this section of the documentation, using it as an
extended set of examples going beyond the simple defaults shown here.
.PP
First, the keys and the meaning of their values, plus examples drawn

.PP
.PP
The syntax expected from configuration files is governed by the rules below.
Again, it is recommended to open the file containing the standard
configurations ("\fIpath/to/critcl/Config\fR") in the editor of your
choice when reading this section of the documentation, using it as an
extended set of examples for the syntax>
.IP [1]
Each logical line of the configuration file consists of one or
more physical lines. In case of the latter the physical lines have to
follow each other and all but the first must be marked by a trailing
backslash. This is the same marker for \fIcontinuation lines\fR as
used by Tcl itself.
.IP [2]
A (logical) line starting with the character "#" (modulo
whitespace) is a comment which runs until the end of the line, and is
otherwise ignored.
.IP [3]
A (logical) line starting with the word "if" (modulo
whitespace) is interpreted as Tcl's \fBif\fR command and executed as
such. I.e. this command has to follow Tcl's syntax for the command,
which may stretch across multiple logical lines. The command will be
run in a save interpreter.
.IP [4]
A (logical) line starting with the word "set" (modulo
whitespace) is interpreted as Tcl's \fBset\fR command and executed as
such. I.e. this command has to follow Tcl's syntax for the command,
which may stretch across multiple logical lines. The command will be
run in a save interpreter.
.IP [5]
A line of the form "\fIplatform\fR \fBvariable\fR \fIvalue\fR"
defines a platform specific configuration variable and value.
The \fBvariable\fR has to be the name of one of the configuration keys
listed earlier in this section, and the \fIplatform\fR string
identifies the platform the setting is for. All settings with the same
identification string form the \fIconfiguration block\fR for this
platform.
.IP [6]
A line of the special form
"\fIplatform\fR \fBwhen\fR \fIexpression\fR"
marks the \fIplatform\fR and all the settings in its
\fIconfiguration block\fR as conditional on the \fIexpression\fR.
.sp
If the build platform is not a prefix of \fIplatform\fR,
nor vice versa the whole block is ignored.
Otherwise the \fIexpression\fR is evaluated via \fBexpr\fR, in the
same safe interpreter used to run any \fBset\fR and \fBif\fR commands
found in the configuration file (see above).
.sp
If the expression evaluates to \fBtrue\fR this configuration block
is considered to be the build platform fo the host and chosen as the
default configuration.
An large example of of this feature is the handling of OS X found in
the standard configuration file, where it selects the architectures to
build based on the version of the operating system, the available SDK,
etc. I.e. it chooses whether the output is universal or not, and
whether it is old-style (ix86 + ppc) versus new-style (ix86 32+64) of
universality.
.IP [7]
At last, a line of the form "\fBvariable\fR \fIvalue\fR"
defines a default configuration variable and value.
.PP
.SS "STUBS TABLES"		This section is for developers of extensions not based on critcl, yet
also wishing to interface with stubs as they are understood and used
by critcl, either by exporting their own stubs table to a
critcl-based extension, or importing a stubs table of a critcl-based
extension into their own.
.PP
To this end we describe the stubs table information of a
package \fBfoo\fR.
.IP [1]
Note that the differences in the capitalization of "foo",
"Foo", "FOO", etc. below demonstrate how to capitalize the actual
package name in each context.
.IP [2]
All relevant files must be available in a sub-directory
"\fIfoo\fR" which can be found on the include search paths.
.IP [3]
The above directory may contain a file "\fIfoo.decls\fR". If
present it is assumed to contain the external representation
of the stubs table the headers mentioned in the following
items are based on.
.sp
critcl is able to use such a file to give the importing package
programmatic access to the imported API, for automatic code
generation and the like.
.IP [4]
The above directory must contain a header file
"\fIfooDecls.h\fR". This file \fIdeclares\fR the exported API.
It is used by both exporting and importing packages. It is usually
generated and must contain (in the order specified):
.RS
.IP [1]
the declarations of the exported, i.e. public, functions of
\fBfoo\fR,
.IP [2]
the declaration of structure "FooStubs" for the stub table,
.IP [3]
the C preprocessor macros which route the invokations of the
public functions through the stubs table.
.sp
These macros must be defined if, and only if, the C preprocessor
macro USE_FOO_STUBS is defined. Package \fBfoo\fR does not
define this macro, as it is allowed to use the exported
functions directly. All importing packages however must define
this macro, to ensure that they do \fInot\fR use any of the
exported functions directly, but only through the stubs table.
.IP [4]
If the exported functions need additional types for their proper
declaration then these types should be put into a separate
header file (of arbitrary name) and "\fIfooDecls.h\fR" should
contain an #include directive to this header at the top.
.RE
.sp
A very reduced, yet also complete example, from a package for
low-level random number generator functions can be found at the end of
this section.
.IP [5]
The above directory must contain a header file
"\fIfooStubLib.h\fR". This file \fIdefines\fR everything needed to use
the API of \fBfoo\fR. Consequently it is used only by importing
packages. It is usually generated and must contain (in the order
specified):
.RS
.IP [1]
An #include directive for "\fItcl.h\fR", with USE_TCL_STUBS
surely defined.
.IP [2]
An #include directive for "\fIfooDecls.h\fR", with USE_FOO_STUBS
surely defined.
.IP [3]
A \fIdefinition\fR of the stubs table variable, i.e.
.nf
const FooStubs* fooStubsPtr;
.fi
.IP [4]
A \fIdefinition\fR of the stubs initializer function, like
.nf
char *
Foo_InitStubs(Tcl_Interp *interp, CONST char *version, int exact)
{
    /*
     * Boiler plate C code initalizing the stubs table variable,
     * i.e. "fooStubsPtr".
     */

    CONST char *actualVersion;

    actualVersion = Tcl_PkgRequireEx(interp, "foo", version,
				     exact, (ClientData *) &fooStubsPtr);

    if (!actualVersion) {
	return NULL;
    }

    if (!fooStubsPtr) {
	Tcl_SetResult(interp,
		      "This implementation of Foo does not support stubs",
		      TCL_STATIC);
	return NULL;
    }

    return (char*) actualVersion;
}
.fi
.RE
This header file must be included by an importing package
\fIexactly once\fR, so that it contains only one definition of both
stubs table and stubs initializer function.
.sp
The importing package's initialization function must further
contain a statement like
.nf
if (!Foo_InitStubs (ip, "1", 0)) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
}
.fi
which invokes \fBfoo\fR's stubs initializer function to set the
local stub table up.
.sp
For a complete example of such a header file see below, at the
end of this section.
.IP [6]
The last item above, about "\fIfooStubLib.h\fR" \fIdiffers\fR
from the regular stub stable system used by Tcl. The regular
system assumes that a static library "\fIlibfoostub.a\fR" was
installed by package \fBfoo\fR, and links it.
.sp
IMVHO critcl's approach is simpler, using \fIonly\fR header
files found in a single location, vs. header files and static
library found in multiple, different locations.
.sp
A second simplification is that we avoid having to extend
critcl's compiler backend with settings for the creation of
static libraries.
.PP
Below is a complete set of example header files, reduced, yet still
complete, from a package for low-level random number generator
functions:
.TP

.SH EXAMPLES
As the set of examples is a bit large, and growing, it has been put
into a separate document. Please see section "Embedding C" in the
document about \fIUsing CriTcl\fR.
.SH "CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.1"
.IP [1]
Fixed bug where \fBcritcl::tsources\fR interpreted relative
paths as relative to the current working directory instead of
relative to the "\fI.critcl\fR" file using the command, as all other
commands of this type do.
.IP [2]
Fixed internals, preventing information collected for multiple
"\fI.critcl\fR" files to leak between them. Notably, \fBcritcl::tk\fR
is not a global configuration option anymore.
.IP [3]
Fixed the command \fBcritcl::license\fR to be a null-operation
in mode "compile & run", instead of throwing an error.
.IP [4]
Fixed the critcl application's interference with the "compile &
run" result cache in \fB-pkg\fR mode by having it use a wholly
separate (and by default transient) directory for that mode.
.IP [5]
Fixed bug where changes to a "\fI.critcl\fR" file did not result
in a rebuild for mode "compile & run". All relevant API commands now
ensure UUID changes.
.IP [6]
Fixed bug in the backend handling of \fBcritcl::debug\fR where
the companion c-sources of a "\fI.critcl\fR" file were not compiled
with debug options, although the "\fI.critcl\fR" file was.
.IP [7]
Fixed bug in \fBcritcl::debug\fR which prevented recognition of
mode "all" when it was not the first argument to the command.
.IP [8]
Fixed bug in "\fIpreload.c\fR" preventing its compilation on
non-windows platforms.
.IP [9]
Fixed long-standing bug in the handling of namespace qualifiers
in the command name argument of \fBcritcl::cproc\fR and
\fBcritcl::ccommand\fR. It is now possible to specify a fully
qualified command name without issues.
.IP [10]
Extended/reworked \fBcritcl::tsources\fR to be the canonical
way of declaring "\fI.tcl\fR" companion files even for mode "compile &
run".
.IP [11]
Extended/reworked \fBcritcl::tsources\fR to allow the use of a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file as its own Tcl companion file.
.IP [12]
Extended \fBcritcl::framework\fR to internally check for OS X
build target, and to ignore the declaration if its not.
.IP [13]
Extended \fBcritcl::failed\fR to be callable more than once in
a "\fI.critcl\fR" file. The first call forces the build, if it was not
done already, to get the result. Further calls return the cached
result of the first call.
.IP [14]
Extended the handling of environment variable CC in the code
determining the compiler to use to deal with (i.e. remove) paths to
the compiler, compiler file extensions, and compiler options specified
after the compiler itself, leaving only the bare name of the compiler.
.IP [15]
Extended the code handling the search for preloaded libraries
to print the paths it searched, making debugging of a search failure
easier.
.IP [16]
A new command \fBcritcl::tcl\fR can be used to declare the
version of Tcl minimally needed to build and run the "\fI.critcl\fR"
file and package. Defaults to 8.4 if not declared. Extended critcl to
have the stubs and headers for all of Tcl 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.
.IP [17]
A new command \fBcritcl::load\fR forces the build and load of a
"\fI.critcl\fR" file. This is the official way for overriding critcl's
default lazy-build-&-load-on-demand scheme for mode "compile & run".
.sp
\fINote\fR that after using \fBcritcl::load\fR /
\fBcritcl::failed\fR in a "\fI.critcl\fR" file it is not possible to
use critcl commands in that file anymore. Doing so will throw an
error.
.IP [18]
Extended the generation of '#line' pragmas to use
\fBinfo frame\fR (if available) to provide the C compiler with exact
line numbers into the "\fI.critcl\fR" file for the reporting of
warnings and errors.
.IP [19]
Extended \fBcritcl::check\fR with logging to help with
debugging build-time checks of the environment, plus an additional
optional argument to provide labeling.
.IP [20]
Added a new command \fBcritcl::checklink\fR which not only
tries to check the environment via compiling the code, but also
its linkability.
.IP [21]
Added a new command \fBcritcl::msg\fR for messaging, like
command \fBcritcl::error\fR is for error reporting. Likewise this is a
hook a user of the package is allowed to override. The default
implementation, used by mode \fIcompile & run\fR does nothing. The
implementation for mode \fIgenerate package\fR prints the message
to stdout.
.sp
Envisioned use is for the reporting of results determined by
\fBcritcl::check\fR and \fBcritcl::checklink\fR during building, to
help with debugging when something goes wrong with a check.
.IP [22]
Exposed the argument processing internals of \fBcritcl::proc\fR
for use by advanced users. The new commands are
.RS
.IP [1]
\fBcritcl::argnames\fR
.IP [2]
\fBcritcl::argcnames\fR
.IP [3]
\fBcritcl::argcsignature\fR
.IP [4]
\fBcritcl::argvardecls\fR
.IP [5]
\fBcritcl::argconversion\fR
.RE
Please see section \fIAdvanced Embedded C Code\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.IP [23]
Extended the critclk package to intercept \fBpackage
provide\fR and record the file -> package name mapping. Plus other
internal changes now allow the use of namespaced package names while
still using proper path names and init function.
.IP [24]
Dropped the unused commands \fBcritcl::optimize\fR and
\fBcritcl::include\fR.
.IP [25]
Dropped \fB-lib\fR mode from the critcl application.
.IP [26]
Dropped remnants of support for Tcl 8.3 and before.
.PP
.SH "CHANGES FOR VERSION 3"
.IP [1]
The command \fBcritcl::platform\fR was deprecated in version
2.1, superceded by \fBcritcl::targetplatform\fR, yet kept for
compatibility. Now it has been removed.
.IP [2]
The command \fBcritcl::compiled\fR was kept with in version 2.1
with semantics in contradiction to its, for compatibility. This
contradiction has been removed, changing the visible semantics of the
command to be in line with its name.
.IP [3]
The change to version 3 became necessary because of the two
incompatible visible changes above.
.IP [4]
Extended the application package with code handling a new
option \fB-tea\fR. Specifying this option invokes a special mode
where critcl generates a TEA package, i.e. wraps the input into a
directory hierarchy and support files which provide it TEA-lookalike
buildsystem.
.sp
This new option, and \fB-pkg\fR, exclude each other. If
both are specified the last used option takes precedence.
.sp
The generated package directory hierarchy is mostly
self-contained, but not fully. It requires not only a working
installation of Tcl, but also working installations of the packages
\fBmd5\fR and \fBcmdline\fR. Both of these are provided by the
\fBTcllib\fR bundle. Not required, but recommended to have
installed are any of the packages which can accelerate md5's
operation, i.e. \fBcryptkit\fR, \fBtcllibc\fR, or
\fBTrf\fR.
.IP [5]
Extended the critcl package with a new command
\fBcritcl::scan\fR taking the path to a "\fI.critcl\fR" file,
statically scanning it, and returning license, version, a list of its
companion files, list of imported APIs, and list of
developer-specified custom configuration options. This data is the
foundation for the TEA wrapping described above.
.sp
Note that this is a \fIstatic\fR scan. While the other build
modes can (must) execute the "\fI.critcl\fR" file and make
platform-specific decisions regarding the assembled C code, companion
files, etc. the TEA wrap mode is not in a position to make
platform-specific decisions. It has to wrap everything which might
conceivably be needed when actually building. Hence the static scan.
This has however its own set of problems, namely the inability to
figure out any dynamic construction of companion file paths, at least
on its own. Thus:
.IP [6]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command
\fBcritcl::owns\fR. While this command is ignored by the regular build
modes the static scanner described above takes its arguments as the
names of companion files which have to be wrapped into the TEA package
and could not be figured by the scanner otherwise, like because of
dynamic paths to \fBcritcl::tsources\fR, \fBcritcl::csources\fR,
getting sourced directly, or simply being adjunct datafiles.
.IP [7]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command
\fBcritcl::api\fR for the management of stubs tables, be it their use,
and/or declaration and export.
.sp
Please see section \fIStubs Table Management\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.IP [8]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command
\fBcritcl::userconfig\fR for the management of developer-specified
custom configuration options, be it their use and/or declaration.
.sp
Please see section \fICustom Build Configuration\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
.IP [9]
Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the
commands \fBcritcl::description\fR, \fBcritcl::summary\fR,
\fBcritcl::subject\fR, \fBcritcl::meta\fR, and
\fBcritcl::buildrequirement\fR for the declaration of TEApot meta data
for/about the package.
.sp
Please see section \fIPackage Meta Data\fR of the
\fBcritcl\fR package documentation for details.
