This document is the reference manpage for the [package critcl::app]
package. Its intended audience are developers working on critcl's
internals.  Writers of packages with embedded C code can ignore this
document.

If you are in need of an overview of the whole system instead, please
go and read the [manpage {Introduction To CriTcl}].

[para]

This package resides in the Application Layer of CriTcl.
[para][image arch_application][para],

implementing the functionality of the [manpage {CriTcl Application}],
and through this, the mode [sectref {Modes Of Operation/Use} {generate package}].

The actual application is (only) a shim wrapping around this
package. It itself is build on top of the core package
[package critcl].
