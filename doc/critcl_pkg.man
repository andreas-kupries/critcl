This document is the reference manpage for the [package critcl]
package. This package is the system's core, i.e. it provides the
essential functionality on top of which everything else is built.

Its intended audience are mainly developers wishing to write Tcl
packages with embedded C code. Some of its sections are however
for developers wishing to understand the package internals, and
the API it provides to the [manpage {CriTcl Application}]. These
sections will be marked, allowing package writers to skip them.

Users of [cmd critcl] on the other hand are hereby refered to the
applications' manpage, i.e. [manpage {CriTcl Application}].

If you are in need of an overview of the whole system instead, please
go and read the [manpage {Introduction To CriTcl}].

[para]

This package resides in the Core Package Layer of CriTcl.
